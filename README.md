# GIP2022-2023
This is a GIP project. am making my own version of geoguesser. Âµ
a game in which you are shown a location. on street view. and based on what you see. make a guess as to where you are.
the closer you guess to the actual location. the better your score
you get 5 minutes to score as much as possible.

ATTENTION
in order for this game to work. you will need this database on port 3306 with the name of the database being "test"
