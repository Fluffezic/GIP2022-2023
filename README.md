# GIP2022-2023
This is a GIP project. I am making my own version of Geoguesser.
a game in which you are shown a location on Google Street View. and based on what you see. Make a guess as to where you are.
the closer you guess to the actual location. the better your score.
You get 5 minutes to score as much as possible.

Run this database on port 3306, with the name of the database being "test."

step 2:
run application.java within "SpringBootHelloWorld."

step 3:
Open "vuemapshtml(1).html" in your browser.

If you did everything correctly, you will now be able to play the game.
